Tynder Crown doesn’t have a clue where her life's headed, and she’s perfectly fine with that. That is, until the murder of the only person she cares for triggers a transformation she can’t stop.

Who killed Tynder’s grandfather? What kind of strange world was he tied up in? And why did he try so hard to keep it a secret from her?

Tynder has a choice now. She can walk away from her grandfather’s mysterious world and let his killer go free, or try to fill the position that was left vacant by his tragic death—private investigator to the magic realm.

If she wants justice for the man who raised her, Tynder has to convince the powerful Fae Queen she’s all in on her new life. If she fails to do so, she could be the queen's next meal.
