It wasn't only Gabe's life that was forever changed on that night he chose to leave the Guardians behind. During his five year absence, the rest of the group battled their own personal demons, some that none of them were prepared to overcome. 

Secrets, dark magic, death, mysterious strangers, lies, all of the Guardians will be tested and some will fail.
