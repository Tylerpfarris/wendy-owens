I"à<p>The Greatest Books of All Timeâ€¦</p>

<p>Okay, fine. These arenâ€™t the greatest of all time, but they are some of <em>my</em> favorites. It is my firm belief that with every book I read I become a better author. My vocabulary grows, the way I view ideas shifts, the way I use the english language is influenced. All of these things are important to grow. Luckily I love to read!</p>
