I"ë<p>How Did I Get Here?</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s because Iâ€™m a writer or what, but I find it fascinating to hear an authorâ€™s journey story. I mean who hasnâ€™t heard J.K. Rowlings story and thought wow, thatâ€™s amazing! I can assure you, mineâ€™s not nearly as exciting as her tale, but I thought I would share it with you anyways. Well, I suppose for me it is just as exciting.</p>
