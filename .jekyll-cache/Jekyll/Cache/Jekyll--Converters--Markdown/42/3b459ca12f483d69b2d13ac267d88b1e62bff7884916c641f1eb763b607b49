I"9<p>My Skills at focusing are amaz–SQUIRREL!</p>

<p>Wait, what was I saying? Oh yeah. Alright, I admit it, my mind often wonders. And as a result, I don’t write in one genre. Trust me; I wish I did. Marketing a lot of books in a single genre is easier and just good business. However, no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to make myself focus on just one. In fact, I am pretty sure with <a href="/books/burning-destiny">Burning Destiny</a> I created a new genre. Let’s see, Urban Paranormal Fantasy Cyber Punk Sci Fi Dystopian. Yeah, that about covers it.</p>
