The Greatest Books of All Time...

Okay, fine. These aren’t the greatest of all time, but they are some of my favorites. It is my firm belief that with every book I read I become a better author. My vocabulary grows, the way I view ideas shifts, the way I use the english language is influenced. All of these things are important to grow. Luckily I love to read!

My taste in books is as eclectic as my taste in music. I’m not sure if this is normal but I don’t read in just one genre. I read Fantasy, Paranormal, Romance, Thrillers. In fact there is very little I don’t read. Today I want to share with you a list of 15 of my favorites.

In no particular order...

1. Harry Potter Series by JK Rowling - I do have a favorite, it’s the seventh book, but I love the series so much I felt it needed listed.
2. Under Different Stars by Amy Bartol - The Kricket Series is stupendiosis, so much so I just made up a word for it.
3. Shatter Me by Tahereh Mafi - Before this book I hadn’t read anything like her style. Tahereh is a trend setter. FYI, the audio book is a must have. Done exquisitely.
4. Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins - come on, you already know how amazing it is.
5. Throne of Glass Series by Sarah J Maas - okay, it’s a series, not a single book but if your read it you won’t regret it!
6. Law of Moses by Amy Harmon - seriously wow on this one guys!
7. The 5 Stages of Falling in Love by Rachel Higginson - Gutted me! Then I read it again. Gutted me a second time.
8. Storm Front by Jim Butcher - I am new to Butcher and boy am I glad I gave him a try. I will be trucking through the Dresden files for sure.
9. Hopeless by Colleen Hoover - I hadn’t read any of Colleen’s books until Hopeless. I’m now hooked. Though I will say Hopeless is still my favorite.
10. BFG by Roald Dahl - inspired me as a child to be a writer.
11. ARV-3 by Cameo Ranae - Intense is all I can say.
12. Smokeless Fire by Samantha Young - Another guilty pleasure I get from Sam is her romance. If you haven’t read On Dublin Street you should.
13. The Fault in Our Stars by John Green - there is something about the way this man captures adolescence so perfectly.
14. Dark Places by Gillian Flynn - I love the way her twisted mind works.
Bring Me Back by Micalea Smeltzer - grab your tissues.

I’d love to hear from you. What’s your favorite book? Just hit reply and let me know.
